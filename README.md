# Odin: Recipes website
This is a project for the HTML Foundations section from The Odin Project's Foundations course.

The purpose of the project is to build a basic recipes website, that will showcase the knowledge of the structure of a website and an HTML document, and of the core HTML elements.

The website will consist of a main index page which will contain links to a few detailed recipe pages. The recipe pages will contain the name of the recipe, an image of the resulting dish, the list of ingredients, and the list of steps.
